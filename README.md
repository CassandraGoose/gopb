# GOPB!

This project is a plant based and vegan food finder tool! Many tools exist out there, all of which leave me wanting and frustrated. This tool aims to provide the information that users actually want, without the fluff of editorials, articles, or outdated information. 

This app (will eventually) gather menu information from restaurants and product information from grocery stores in an automated fashion. Assisted by OpenAI's ChatGPT, the data will be transformed for easy searching and categorization. 

Then, an editor will be in charge of adjustments and straightforward ratings and reviews in order to help guide users. It's possible that users will also be allowed to post reviews in the future, but I haven't decided if there would be value in this beyond what Google Maps already supplies. 

With the app set up in this way, a user can now search for something that they want to eat and _know_ if a restaurant in their area has it. If they're just using Google, it's hard to know what's vegan, what is actually on the menu, and what's actually good; but really, it's almost impossible to know if a restaurant is truly vegan or if an item exists at the restaurant simply utilizing Google Maps or other tools. I want to be able to search for 'perogi' and know immediately if I have access to a delicious, plant-based perogi without having to sift through hundreds of non-vegan restaurants. 

Utlimately, plant based eating will be easy! GOPB!
