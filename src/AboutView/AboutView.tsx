      <p>
        GOPB! (Which stands for Go Plant-based!) is a site concept that aims to
        make finding plant based and vegan food quick and easy. One of the
        biggest barriers to going vegan is the barrier of information. There are
        many sites out there, but information is often disparate or outdated. By
        targeting one city and maintaining a news-like editor system, we intend
        to keep information valuable.
